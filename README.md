### getting started

first, be sure you have node and npm installed.

then, clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
```
to install dependancies.


### build

on the command line, run

```
npm run build
```

this will yield `./build`, in which you'll find `./build/index.html`, which is a single built file containing all of the javascript and css from the `./src` directory.
